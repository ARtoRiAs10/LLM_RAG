## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to working with the community to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities that are reported to us. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

**To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:**

1.  **Use Private Reporting:** Please report the vulnerability privately using one of the following methods:
    *   **Primary Method (GitHub Security Advisories):** Navigate to the "Security" tab of this repository, and click on "Report a vulnerability". This is the most secure and preferred method as it creates a private fork and allows for direct, confidential communication.
    *   **Secondary Method (Email):** If you are unable to use GitHub Security Advisories, please send an email to `[YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE]`. **Please replace this placeholder with your actual email address.**

2.  **Provide Detailed Information:** Your report should include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
    *   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    *   Any relevant proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or logs.
    *   The version of the code or commit hash where the vulnerability was discovered.

### What to Expect

After you have submitted a vulnerability report, we will make every effort to:

-   Acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
-   Provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability and its severity within **7 business days**.
-   Keep you informed of our progress as we investigate and, if necessary, work on a fix.
-   Credit you for your discovery once the vulnerability is resolved, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released and an appropriate amount of time has passed for users to update.

Thank you for helping to keep this project safe and secure.
